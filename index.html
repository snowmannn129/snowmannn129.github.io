          As a highly motivated and experienced HVAC/R Technician, former HVAC/R Instructor, and Chief Engineer, I am actively seeking a remote work opportunity that will allow me to contribute meaningfully while accommodating my current physical condition due to a back injury. My extensive background in HVAC/R systems, commitment to education and training, and leadership experience as a Chief Engineer make me an ideal candidate for a position that requires both technical expertise and effective communication in a remote setting. Additionally, I am open to exploring any opportunity that can benefit from my diverse skill set. I am eager to leverage my in-depth knowledge of HVAC/R technologies, maintenance procedures, and educational methodologies to add value to an innovative and forward-thinking organization.        </p>
